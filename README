LeitorEscritor was written in Operating Systems I class. A really simple 
app that simulates semaphores resource concurrency control between two 
kinds of processes: readers and writers. The strings are in brazillian 
portuguese and GUI in SWING.

Main class: InterfaceLeitorEscritor.java.

Good luck!
