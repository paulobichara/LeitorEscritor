LeitorEscritor was written in Operating Systems I class. A really simple 
app that simulates semaphores resource concurrency control between two 
kinds of processes: readers and writers. The strings are in brazillian 
portuguese and GUI in SWING.

I'm submitting with the eclipse project structure, so, to run, just 
checkout the project folder into your eclipse's workspace, go to 
"Import -> Existing Project Into Workspace" and select its folder. The 
main class is InterfaceLeitorEscritor.java.

Good luck!
